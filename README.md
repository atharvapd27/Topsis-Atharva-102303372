## About the Project
This repository contains a Python implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method.

TOPSIS is a **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)** technique used to rank multiple alternatives based on their distance from:
- the **ideal best solution**, and
- the **ideal worst solution**

The alternative closest to the ideal best and farthest from the ideal worst is ranked highest.
